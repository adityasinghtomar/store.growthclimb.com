= 7. Do I need any coding and designing skills? =

No. WP funnels come with different types of templates that meet the design and structure requirements to sell different types of products and courses.

So you can simply choose a template and update the content without worrying about the design and codes.


= 8. What are the basic requirements for WP Funnels to work? =
You will simply need WooCommerce and WP Funnels installed.

Then, depending on your requirements, you can choose your own page builder to design the pages. We recommend using Elementor.

These are enough to start creating funnels.


= 9. What Page builders do WP Funnels support? =

Currently, WPFunnels works well with Gutenberg, Elementor, Divi, and Oxygen builder. We’re looking to support more page builders soon.

You will get to add important page elements such as the Next Step button, Checkout form, etc when designing your pages.

If you use Gutenberg, Elementor, Oxygen, or Divi, you will get their respective blocks, widgets, and modules for funnel creation.

Meanwhile, you may use our <a href="https://getwpfunnels.com/docs/wpfunnels-shortcodes/shortcodes-to-create-a-functional-sales-funnel/"target="_blank">shortcodes</a> for other page builders.

= 10. I can't find a certain funnel feature that I need = 

If you can't find a certain feature that you think is available in the plugin, you can open a thread and mention the feature.

And if there is a feature that is not available in the plugin but you think will be helpful for building funnels, you can <a href="https://getwpfunnels.com/ideas/" target="_blank">let us know here.</a>

= 10. How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. 

The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. <a href="https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wpfunnels" target="_blank">Report a security vulnerability.</a>
